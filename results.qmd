By overlaying restaurant coordinates on the NYC borough map using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), we can visualize the spatial clustering of different culinary traditions. This visualization moves beyond simple counts to reveal distinct cultural enclaves (such as the three major "Chinatowns" in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) versus cuisines that are uniformly distributed across the city, such as American or Cafe/Deli establishments.

### 3.1 Hygiene Score Analysis based on Cuisine

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Filter data for the plot
score_analysis <- restaurants |>
  # Exclude "Other" to keep the comparison meaningful
  filter(cuisine_group != "Other") |>
  # Remove extreme outliers (scores > 60 are rare) for better readability
  filter(mean_score < 60)

# Combined Boxplot + Violin Plot
ggplot(score_analysis, aes(x = reorder(cuisine_group, -mean_score, FUN = median), y = mean_score)) +
  
  # Violin plot (bottom layer): Shows the shape/density of the distribution
  geom_violin(fill = "grey90", color = NA, alpha = 0.5) +
  
  # Boxplot (top layer): Shows median and quartiles
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = "steelblue", outlier.size = 0.5, outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  
  # Dashed red line at 13 (Threshold for Grade A)
  geom_hline(yintercept = 13, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", linewidth = 0.8) +
 annotate(
  "text",
  x = 0.7,
  y = 14,
  label = "Grade A Limit (13)",
  color = "red",
  size = 2.5,
  hjust = 0
) +
  
  # Flip coordinates for readable labels
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Hygiene Scores by Cuisine Type",
       subtitle = "Lower score indicates better hygiene performance",
       x = "Cuisine Group",
       y = "Average Inspection Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),

  )
```

We utilized a combined violin and boxplot to analyze the distribution of hygiene scores across cuisine groups. The red dashed line at a score of 13 marks the critical threshold for an "A" grade; the plot reveals that while the median scores for most cuisines fall within the "A" range, certain groups (such as Latin American and Asian cuisines) exhibit a wider distribution with a longer tail of higher scores, suggesting higher variance in compliance or inspection complexity.

### 3.2. Where are the less clean restaurants located?

```{r}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Load and Transform Map (Exactly like the working code)
nyc_map <- read_sf("/Users/dian/restaurants-in-nyc/nybb_25d/nybb.shp") |>
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

# 2. Clean Data (Using the filter logic that worked for you)
# We use final_data, but filter out bad coordinates just like your example did
map_data <- final_data |>
  filter(!is.na(Longitude) & !is.na(Latitude)) |>
  # This filter removes "0,0" points that would distort the map
  filter(Longitude < -70 & Latitude > 35)

# 3. Plot: One Big Map (No Facets)
ggplot() +
  # Layer 1: The Base Map (Grey background)
  geom_sf(data = nyc_map, fill = "grey95", color = "grey80") +
  
  # Layer 2: The Dots (Using geom_point is safer/easier here)
  geom_point(data = map_data, 
             aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = last_grade), 
             size = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  
  # Styling
  scale_color_manual(values = c("P" = "cornflowerblue", 
                                "N" = "purple",
                                "B" = "orange", 
                                "C" = "red"),
                     na.value = "grey80") +
  
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Restaurant Hygiene Grades in NYC",
       color = "Grade")
```



## 4. Correlation between inspection score and public sentiment: 


```{r}
library(ggalluvial)

# 1. Prepare data: Bin the Yelp ratings
alluvial_data <- final_data |>

  group_by(cuisine_group, last_grade, yelp_cat, status) |>
  summarise(freq = n(), .groups = "drop")

# 2. Plot
ggplot(alluvial_data,
       aes(axis1 = cuisine_group, 
           axis2 = last_grade, 
           axis3 = yelp_cat,
           axis4 = status,
           y = freq)) +
  
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = cuisine_group), width = 1/12) +
  geom_stratum(width = 1/12, fill = "grey90", color = "grey") +
  
  # Add text labels to the strata
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 3) +
  
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Cuisine", "Grade", "Yelp Rating", "Status")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "From Cuisine to Closure: The Flow of Restaurant Quality",
       y = "Number of Restaurants")
```
